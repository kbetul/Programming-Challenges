# Programming-Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges from different platforms.  
It serves as a personal archive to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and explore various algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

- **AdventOfCode** – Yearly December coding puzzles, organized by year (e.g., 2023, 2024).  
- **Codewars** – Kata solutions across different ranks and languages.  
- **Codingame** – Puzzle and bot-programming challenges.  

## Notes

- Each folder contains standalone solutions with the problem statement (if allowed) or a short description.  
- Solutions reflect my learning process at the time — some may be optimized, others intentionally left as first attempts.  
- Contributions or suggestions for improvements are welcome!
